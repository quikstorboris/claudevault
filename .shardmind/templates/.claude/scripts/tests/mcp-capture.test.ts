/**
 * Filing a work record.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and each is asserted directly rather than
 * inferred from a happy path:
 *
 *   - a caller-supplied folder is VALIDATED against the exposed roots, so a
 *     destination string cannot become an arbitrary write;
 *   - the final name is claimed ATOMICALLY, because the obvious
 *     check-then-rename loses a whole capture to a race with no error; and
 *   - a link is emitted only when it resolves, because a note that
 *     manufactures broken links degrades the graph silently.
